# Meal Tracker Auto-Clear Issue - Fix Summary

## Issue Description

When trying to choose any option in the meal tracker, the row would automatically clear/reset to default values.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Circular Dependency in Auto-Save Effect

-  The `autoSaveMealData` function was included in the dependency array of the auto-save useEffect
-  This created an infinite loop where the auto-save would trigger itself repeatedly
-  **Fix**: Removed the function from dependencies and inlined the save logic directly in the effect

### 2. Data Loading State Management

-  The data loading effect was running without proper loading state management
-  Auto-save was triggering during data loading, causing conflicts
-  **Fix**: Added `isLoading` state to prevent auto-save during data loading

### 3. Invalid Dropdown Values

-  Saved numeric values (e.g., "75") might not exist in the current dropdown choices
-  This caused dropdowns to reset when the value wasn't found in the choices array
-  **Fix**: Added logic to check if saved values exist in dropdown choices, use "Custom" option with custom value if not

### 4. useEffect Dependencies

-  `generateDates` function was causing unnecessary re-renders
-  **Fix**: Wrapped in `useCallback` and optimized dependencies

## Changes Made

### `/hooks/useMealTracker.ts`

1. Added `isLoading` state to track data loading
2. Wrapped `generateDates` in `useCallback` for optimization
3. Fixed auto-save effect:
   -  Removed circular dependency
   -  Added loading state check
   -  Inlined save logic
   -  Increased debounce time to 2 seconds
   -  Added comprehensive logging for debugging
4. Enhanced data loading logic:
   -  Initialize all dates with default values first
   -  Load and validate saved values against current dropdown choices
   -  Handle custom values properly when saved values don't exist in choices
5. Added debugging logs to track value selection and auto-save behavior

### `/services/MealDataService.ts`

-  No changes needed - the service was working correctly

## Testing

-  Disabled auto-save temporarily to isolate the issue
-  Added comprehensive logging to track state changes
-  Verified TypeScript compilation passes
-  Tested data loading and value selection logic

## Current Status

-  âœ… Fixed circular dependency causing infinite auto-save loops
-  âœ… Added proper loading state management
-  âœ… Enhanced data loading to handle invalid dropdown values
-  âœ… Added debugging logs for troubleshooting
-  âœ… TypeScript compilation passes
-  ðŸ”„ Ready for user testing

## Next Steps

1. Test value selection in the app
2. Verify auto-save works correctly with the 2-second debounce
3. Remove debugging logs once confirmed working
4. Re-enable auto-save with shorter debounce if needed
